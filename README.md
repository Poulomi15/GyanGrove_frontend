# Frontend Developer Internship Assignment

This is a single-page application (SPA) created as part of a frontend developer internship assignment. The goal of this project is to showcase a responsive portfolio website that integrates with a public REST API to display dynamic content. The project aims to evaluate skills in creating responsive designs, leveraging modern front-end frameworks, designing visually appealing UIs, and building fast, modern websites.

## Features

- **Framework Utilization:** The SPA is built using the React JavaScript library, demonstrating dynamic user experiences.
- **UI Aesthetics & CSS Mastery:** The UI is designed with attention to layout, color schemes, typography, and subtle animations. Advanced CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid are utilized for enhanced visual appeal.
- **Performance Optimization:** The site is optimized for speed with strategies like image optimization, lazy loading, and minimizing HTTP requests.
- **REST API Integration:** Integration with a public REST API fetches and displays dynamic content, such as project details.
- **Content Sections:** Introduction, skills, and projects sections dynamically populated with data.
